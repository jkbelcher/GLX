### GLX ###

GLX embeds the [LX](https://github.com/heronarts/LX/) framework in a cross-platform GUI environment using [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) and [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx). This forms the foundation of the [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co) digital lighting workstation application. 

### Contact and Collaboration ###

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Want to solicit some help, request new framework features, or just ask a random question? Drop me a line at mark@chromatik.co or [join the Discord](https://chromatik.co/discord).
